## Project Description

This project is a hosted App that allows us to access and manipulate data stored in an SQL database served utilising an API.  The app has been constructed using node.js and React.

The main utility of the App is to serve news articles; these can be sorted and order.  We also have the ability to view comments left on each article, add comments and delete them if we are the owner.  Articles can also be viewed/filtered by topic.
